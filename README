cuecmd is a drop-in replacement for Svend Sorensen's cuetag script.
It is written in POSIX shell in order not to have dependency on the
cueprint program. It can be just placed somewhere in user's shared
home directory and will work on any host regardless of cuetools
availability.


INSTALLATION

To install the script system-wide type

   sudo make install

To install into your home type

   make PREFIX=~ install


NOTES FOR RUSSIAN USERS

Usually cue sheets use cp1251 encoding for cyrillic. If you are
not using ru_RU.cp1251 locale you will likely have troubles with
FLAC tags encoding. There are a number of ways to get it working.

If your system still has locale ru_RU.cp1251 (no matter whether
you use it or not) you can just run cuecmd as follows

   LANG=ru_RU.cp1251 cuecmd cuefile.cue *.flac

It works with metaflac driver because metaflac respects current
locale settings and converts encoding to UTF-8 by its own means.

If your system lacks support of ru_RU.cp1251 locale you have to
convert cue sheet encoding before use it with cuecmd. You can do
this with the iconv utility as follows

   iconv -f cp1251 cuefile.cue > cuefile_locale.cue
